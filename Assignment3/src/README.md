This program can be run by calling the Driver class like it is called in the example runs.
I have also finished the additional activation functions and deterministic weight initialization
extra credit opportunities. 

I wasn't able to spend much time with the experimental section of the assignment because the execution time of the program
for the test sets were too long to wait for and I needed to focus my attention on other assignments. The best
performance I could get from each test set is using a neural network with a single 128-neuron layer.
